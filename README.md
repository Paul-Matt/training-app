## Final project for Haaga Helia University of Applied Sciences [Mobile programming course](https://opinto-opas.haaga-helia.fi/course_unit/SWD4TF020), front end.

Project was done using React Native.

The goal was to 

- use phone's periphrals such as camera, localization, compass, motion sensor
- use a form and save the data onto a database either on a server or locally on the phone (Expo SQLite)
- have CRUD functionalities of data

Did this when I was starting out learning about programming, so there's a lot of finnish in the code and in comments.
